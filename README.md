# PASSWORD GENERATOR

## Description

This repository features a JavaScript codebase designed to generate random passwords based on user preferences. Users can customize their passwords by selecting options for lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Additionally, the password length is flexible, allowing users to choose a length ranging from 8 to 128 characters.

The JavaScript functionality within the code utilizes arrays, array methods, for loops, and functions to efficiently generate secure and customizable passwords. This project provides a practical example of how these core JavaScript concepts can be applied to create a useful tool for generating secure passwords.
